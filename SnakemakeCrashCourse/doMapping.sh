# How snakemake handles the cluster calls:
# 1. Snakemake should be run on the login node in a virtual terminal (use tmux -- recommended -- or screen)
# 2. Snakemake first parses the Snakefile and create the workflow as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
# 3. If needed it creates the requested conda environments
# 4. It parses the --cluster-config file and reads a python dictionary indexed by rule names and __default__
# 5. For each rule to be run, it the --cluster sbatch command and substitutes the {cluster.xxx}
#    variables for corresponding values from the --cluster-config for the rule
# 6. It sends the job to the slurm queue -- when possible it will run rules/jobs in parallel
# 7. When job is started, it first creates any conda-environment that is needed, and then runs the rule.
# 8. When the job returns, snakemake checks it it has failed or succeeded and then decide this
#    means that it should start another job/rule that depends on the output of the one just run.
