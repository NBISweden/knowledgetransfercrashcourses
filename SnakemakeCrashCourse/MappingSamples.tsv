# Minimal tabular sample file for the Mapping workflow. Please create
# you own to match your needs. The column headers 'sample' and 'fastq_1'
# and 'fastq_2' are currently the only ones used i the Snakefile, but
# you can have columns with additional metadata, e.g., 'read_direction'.
#
sample	fastq_1	fastq_2	read_direction
s_1	/path/to/ExampleData/fastq/SRR3222409-19_1.fq.gz	/path/to/ExampleData/fastq/SRR3222409-19_2.fq.gz	forward
# < additional rows can be added >
#
# If read in  the Snakefile as
# `samples = pd.read_csv("mappingSamples.tsv", sep="[\t,]",
#                        comment="#", engine="python"
#                        comment="#").set_index("samples")`,
# these can be expanded to python lists or dictionaries in Snakefile
# rules, e.g., as (notice that `set_index` above sets
# row.names = column 'sample'):
#   - samples.index => [ "S_1_R1"]
#   - samples["fastq_1"] => {
#        "s_1" : "path/to/ExampleData/fastq/SRR3222409-19_1.fq.gz",
#        <...>
#     }
#   - samples["fastq_1"]["s_1"] => "/path/to/ExampleData/fastq/SRR3222409-19_1.fq.gz"
