# The cluster config file could be yaml ( as here) or json
# format. This file is used when sending snakemake rules or groups of
# rules (see SlamdunkSnakefile) to the UPPMAX cluster.  Each 'cluster
# rule' lists values for options used in the slurm sbatch command used
# by UPPMAX

# Unless a rule (group of rules) is explicitly listed below, it will
# be handled by _default_. Moreover, these values will be inherited by
# all other rules, unless explicitly changed.
__default__ :
  name: default            # name of jobs shown in, e.g., jobinfo
  account: snic2018-8-390  # Uppmax account to use
  time: 0-02:00:00         # Allocated time
  partition: core          # Type of computational unit allocated, core or node
  n: 1                     # Allocated number of computational units
  other: "--mail-user your@email --mail-type=FAIL,STAGEOUT" # email are sent to this address on failed jobs

## Some rules may require differnt resources than those in the default:

# NB! the following is just examplifying this behaviour, the nsp and
# count rules are actually run as a group (see further down)

# The snp rule uses more threads, so we need to allocate more cores
# for it
snp:
  name: snp
  n: 2
  time: 0-00:30:00

# The count rule uses a single thread, but requires additional memory
# (RAM).  Because there is a fixed amount of memory allotted per core,
# we still need to allocate more cores for it.
count:
  name: count
  n: 2
  time: 0-02:30:00


## groups are treated same way as rules, but runs several rules as one
## job

# runs rules map, index and filter
mapAndFilter:
  name: mapAndFilter
  time: 0-01:30:00

# run rules snp (which runs on >1 core) and count (which requires more
# (RAM) memory than that assocaited with 1 core
snpAndCount:
  name: snpAndCount
  n: 2
  time: 0-02:45:00
